# THIS SITE WAS USED AS MY PORTFOLIO

- Link: https://rafael-saraiva-mielczarski.github.io/Portfolio/.
- Here I applied all the knowledge pratically, building something from the zero that is exclusively mine.
- I only used HTML5 and CSS3.
- I used Github Pages to host the site, making acessible to anyone.
- This project is deprecated for now, since I built a new and better portfolio.
